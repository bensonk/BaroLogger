Barometric Pressure Logger
==========================

This is the arduino code for a barometric pressure logger.  It's hacked
together nastily from a couple of hunks of sample code, but it does work
nicely.  It produces a file on the inserted SD card called "data.csv" that
contains temperature and barometric pressure from a BMP085 sensor.  I'm using
the sparkfun BMP085 breakout board, but the adafruit board would work just as
well.  If you'd like a wiring diagram, ping me and I'd be happy to whip one up.
